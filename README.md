<!--
    Small script using the Composer autoload function.
    Created the Hello class inside the App namespace, generated the composer.json
    index.php is requiring the autoload.php generated by Composer, allowing it to access
    all classes created on the project (here, Hello.php).
    We can then run the method "talk" insided index.php and have "Hello World !" displayed.
